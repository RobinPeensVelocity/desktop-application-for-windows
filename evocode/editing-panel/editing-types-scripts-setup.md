# Editing types/Scripts setup

### **Editing types** 

To select Editing types click on the![](../../.gitbook/assets/1%20%282%29.png)button on the main menu of EvoCode. There are two types available:

#### Release mode

This mode of compilation is used as Product ready mode. If the source code is free from errors and ready for applying user can select this mode.

#### Debug mode

This mode of compilation is used for debugging source code. It is very useful for finding mistakes before script usage. Users can debug C\# code. The mode can be running from the main panel button![](../../.gitbook/assets/2%20%2859%29.png).

Three other buttons are available for debug mode: 

* Step info![](../../.gitbook/assets/3%20%2859%29.png)  – allows going through all code lines independently of breakpoints; 
* Step over![](../../.gitbook/assets/4-copy%20%285%29.png)– allows going over some program steps; 
* Step out![](../../.gitbook/assets/5%20%2818%29.png)  – script will be running until the breakpoint is reached.

To begin debugging source code, users should first set breakpoints. A breakpoint can be set by clicking between the code line numbers and the edge of the source code editor window, or by clicking on the![](../../.gitbook/assets/7%20%2824%29.png)button. After placing a breakpoint it will be visible in the margin as a red circle. A user can remove all breakpoints from the source code by clicking on the![](../../.gitbook/assets/8%20%283%29.png)button.

### **Scripts** **setup**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/6%20%284%29.png)

The Scripts setup window shows information about selected module. This information is specified during the creation of any algorithm.

* Main symbol – evokes the lookup for selection of the main symbol for backtesting;
* Aggregation – allows to select the type of aggregation \(time\) of historical data;
* Range – allows to adjust what range of historical data will be used for backtesting.
