If a user has compiled an indicator or strategy in EvoCode but does not have the source code for it, EvoCode will still allow the user to run the code and test it on historical data. To do this, select the recompiled file with the strategy and upload it to EvoCode. Then simply proceed to testing as if it was an indicator or strategy with the source code.
