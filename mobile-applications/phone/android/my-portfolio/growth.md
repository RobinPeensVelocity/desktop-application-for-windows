The vertical scale shows the values of the Portfolio balance. The horizontal scale shows the time period in days. The Projected balance value is used for the chart plotting. 

Under the chart there is a table which shows Portfolio balance by days:

* Date - the values are displayed for the specified month.
* Portfolio balance - shows Portfolio balance on a corresponding day.
