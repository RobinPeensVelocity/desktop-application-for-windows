* Pie chart - shows the amount of funds that were invested into the Portfolio considering “Portfolio balance” as well as “Holding period rate of return” from the moment of investment.
* Doughnut chart - shows the “Portfolio allocation” values. The number of chart sectors corresponds to the number of assets in the portfolio as well as Cash. If there is no portfolio \(positions\) at the account, the chart will be plain and Cash will be displayed. The allocation will be dynamic as it will be built by the current investor’s portfolio. 

## Cards

Under the diagram a user can find cards that show assets/cash included in the portfolio.
