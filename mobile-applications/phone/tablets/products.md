In order to open the panel select it from the More section that is located in the main menu of the mobile app. The panel contains three tabs:

* Active – this tab contains a list of Products to which the user has already subscribed i.e. those subscription requests which are manually confirmed by the Admin or confirmed in the automatic mode;
* Catalogue – contains a list of Products that are available to the User for subscription;
* Requests – contains subscribe/unsubscribe requests sent by the user.

Subscription to the Product of interest is carried out by tapping the ‘Subscribe’ button. There are two subscription options - if the User does not need to sign additional documents or if there is a need to sign them. 

If the documents are not required to be signed, then the subscription request will be created immediately after clicking the appropriate button. This request will await verification by the admin and after its confirming the User will be subscribed to the Product.

In case it is required to sign documents in order to subscribe to the Product, then an additional ‘Sign documents’ screen that allows to take the necessary actions will be shown to the User:
