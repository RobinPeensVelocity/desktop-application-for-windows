The **"**Other" settings section cannot be displayed in the application settings if the biometric authentication is not checked in the system settings of the device or it is blocked. 

Biometric authentication enables a user to log in to the mobile application more securely by using the Fingerprint or FaceID features.

To apply Fingerprint in the application for subsequent logins, a user should put his finger on the sensor.

After this, the checkbox More -&gt; Settings -&gt; Other -&gt; Biometric authentication becomes True. On subsequent calls of the Login screen form, if the Biometric authentication setting is checked in the application, then the following dialog box is automatically displayed:

The user authentication occurs after putting a finger on the sensor and successful fingerprint recognition.

In case the FaceID feature is available and activated on the user device, it can be used as an additional application login option instead of the Fingerprint.
