![](../../../.gitbook/assets/3%20%2815%29.png)

* Account – specifies an account used by default, available for a multi-account user;
* Symbol – specifies a symbol used by default. This is the instrument that will be shown first when you load the Chart panel or Order entry panel;
* Set SL/TP values in offset \(for new orders\) – if checked, order prices are shown in offset, if unchecked – in absolute values;
* Show offset in – allows to select one of the available modes for offset displaying:
  * Ticks;
  * Ticks \(fractional ticks for Forex\);
  * Points.
* Use stop limit instead stop – allows placing stop limit orders instead of stop orders. When checked, the field 'Limit offset, ticks' becomes available;
* Limit offset, ticks – allows to adjust a default quantity of ticks for offset of a limit price. Available when 'Use stop limit instead stop' is checked;
* Order type – allows specifying order type, available values: Market, limit, Stop, Stop Limit, Tr. stop, OCO, Manual;
* Market/Limit\(Stop limit\)/Stop TIF – allows setting up TIF for market/limit \(stop limit\)/stop orders respectively, actual for both auto and manual trading;
* Types manager – allows setting defaults.

To specify additional settings for orders you need to open 'Types manager' and select a symbol type - Forex, Futures, Equities, etc. for which you want to set up default lots values. It is also possible to override default lots values for separate symbols by adding them to the symbol types tree using "+" button. In order to apply symbol type default lots settings, just delete symbol from the tree using context menu:

* SL/TP default offset, ticks – specifies a default value of offset field for SL/TP;
* User quantity coefficient – is a default increment applied to all quantity counters;
* Price increment \(arrow\), ticks – determines the increment value \(e.g. the Limit price field in the Order entry panel\) when pressing the Up Arrow \(^\) key;
* Default lots setup – allows enabling default lot sizes for orders of selected symbol types or specific symbols which will be available in OE section.

If 'Show offset in = Ticks \(fractional ticks for Forex\)', then options 'SL/TP default offset, ticks' in the Forex instrument type will be displayed in decimal view and in the corresponding format. For example, 10 ticks will be displayed as 1.0, and 50 ticks as 5.0, depending on which value is set in the option. If 'Show offset in' is NOT 'Ticks \(fractional ticks for Forex\)', values of the options 'SL/TP default offset, ticks' are displayed by default, e.g. 10 ticks, 50 ticks.

If you have open positions on symbols which have overnight coefficients, you will get overnight margin notification message "Warning: on 12:49 Exchange will be closed. The margin requirements will be recalculated with the overnight coefficients before closing".

The overnight warning message shows the following items: Account \(Account for which the margin coefficients are switched to overnight\), Margin available, Maintenance margin \(based on overnight coefficients\), Overnight margin available.

Overnight margin available = Balance + all risks - Overnight total maint. req.

If Overnight margin available &lt; 0, user will get a message "You don’t have enough margin for overnight, we force close some positions and cancel orders".
