# Trading ideas

Trading idea is an investment recommendation based on the market analysis. It includes predefined parameters for order placement as well as text description and chart snapshot.

The panel allows to send Trading ideas and subscribe to them, depending on the user’s role – user-analyst or user-subscriber.

### **User-analyst**

User-analyst is a user who can create, delete and send Trading ideas to user-subscribers but is not allowed to trade by himself. For the user-analysts the Trading ideas analyst panel is available in the terminal from the ‘Tools’ list in the Top menu. Trading ideas analyst panel contains 2 tabs:

**New** – ​tab that allows setting all parameters for sending a new Trading idea:
