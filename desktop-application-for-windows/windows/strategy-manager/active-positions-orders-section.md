Active positions will also be displayed in this tab even if the terminal loses its connection to the server. When there is no connection in the terminal:

* The strategy can be launched even if the user is not logged in, as soon as the connection occurs and trading data is available, the strategy begins to process it and starts trading;
* In case there was a reconnect of the client during the trading session, the strategy continues to work, as soon as the reconnect manager has restored the connection, trading data is available and the strategy starts to process it and continues trading.
